# Unexpected Behavior with calc() in CSS Flexbox

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically within a flexbox context.  The example shows how an incorrect application of `calc()` can lead to unexpected layout results.

## Problem

The `calc()` function is powerful, but it's crucial to understand how it interacts with different layout mechanisms.  The provided CSS demonstrates how calculating width as `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox item can result in the element not respecting the expected size due to flexbox's sizing algorithm.

## Solution

The solution provided clarifies the proper approach for applying `calc()` in a flexbox layout.  It emphasizes understanding the context in which `calc()` operates and may suggest alternative approaches to achieve the desired layout behavior.
